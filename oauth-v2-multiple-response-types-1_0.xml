      <t>This specification aims to provide guidance on proper encoding of responses to
        OAuth 2.0 Authorization Requests, where the request specifies a response type that includes
        space characters.</t>

	  <list style="hanging">

	    <t hangText="fragment">
	      In this mode, response parameters are encoded in

	      when redirecting back to the Client.
	    </t>
	    <t hangText="form_post">
	      In this mode, response parameters are encoded
	      as HTML form values that are auto-submitted in the User Agent,
	      and thus are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the client,
	      with the result parameters being encoded in the response body
	      using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format.
	      The action attribute of the form MUST be the client's Redirection URI.
	      The method of the form attribute MUST be <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx>.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Any technique supported by the User Agent MAY be used to cause
	      the submission of the form, and any form content necessary to support this
	      MAY be included, such as submit controls and client-side scripting commands.
	      However, the client MUST be able to process the message without regard for
	      the mechanism by which the form submission is initiated.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  For purposes of this specification, the default Response Mode for the
	  OAuth 2.0 <spanx style="verb">code</spanx>
	  <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> is the query encoding.
	  For purposes of this specification, the default Response Mode for the
	  OAuth 2.0 <spanx style="verb">token</spanx>
	  <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> is the fragment encoding.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that it is expected that additional Response Modes may be defined
	  by other specifications in the future, including possibly
	  <spanx style="verb">postMessage</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">CORS</spanx>.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="MultiValueResponseTypes" title="Multiple-Valued Response Types">

	<t>
	  When a multiple-valued response type is defined, it is RECOMMENDED
	  that the following encoding rules be applied for the issued response
	  from the Authorization Endpoint.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The all parameters returned from the Authorization Endpoint SHOULD
	  use the same Response Mode.
	  This recommendation applies to both success and error responses.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Rationale:  This significantly simplifies Client parameter processing.
	  It also can have positive performance benefits, as described below.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For instance, if a response includes fragment encoded parts,
	  a User Agent Client component must be involved to complete processing of the response.
	  If a new query parameter is added to the Client URI, it will cause the User Agent
	  to re-fetch the Client URI,
	  causing discontinuity of operation of the User Agent based Client components. If
	  only fragment encoding is used, the User Agent will simply reactivate the Client
	  component, which can then process the fragment and
	  also convey any parameters to a Client host as necessary, e.g., via XmlHttpRequest.
	  Therefore, full fragment encoding always results in lower latency for response processing.
	</t>

    <section anchor="id_token" title="ID Token Response Type">

      <t>This section registers a new response type, the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx>, in accordance
        with the stipulations in the OAuth 2.0 specification, Section 8.4. The intended purpose of
        the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> is that it MUST provide an assertion of
        the identity of the Resource Owner as understood by the server. The assertion MUST 
        specify a targeted audience, e.g. the requesting Client. However, the specific semantics of
        the assertion and how it can be validated are not specified in this document.</t>

      <t>

	  When supplied as the <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> parameter in an OAuth 2.0
          Authorization Request, a successful response MUST include the parameter
          <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx>.
	  The Authorization Server SHOULD NOT return an OAuth 2.0
	  Authorization Code, Access Token, or Access Token Type in a successful
          response to the grant request. If a <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx>
	  is supplied, the User Agent SHOULD be redirected
          there after granting or denying access.
	  The request MAY include a <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter,
	  and if so, the
          server MUST echo its value as a response parameter when issuing
	  either a successful response or an error response.
	  The default Response Mode for this Response Type is the fragment encoding
	  and the query encoding MUST NOT be used.
	  Both successful and error responses SHOULD be returned using the supplied
	  Response Mode, or if none is supplied, using the default Response Mode.
	</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Returning the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> in a fragment reduces the likelihood that the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> leaks
        during transport and mitigates the associated risks to the privacy of the user (Resource Owner).</t>

    <section anchor="none" title="None Response Type">

      <t>This section registers the response type <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>, in accordance
        with the stipulations in the OAuth 2.0 specification, Section 8.4.
        The intended purpose is to enable
        use cases where a party requests the server to register a
	grant of access to a Protected Resource on behalf of a Client but requires
        no access credentials to be returned to the Client at that time. The means
        by which the Client eventually obtains the access credentials is left unspecified here.</t>

      <t>One scenario is where a user wishes to purchase an
        application from a market, and desires to authorize application installation and grant
        the application access to Protected Resources in a single step. However, since the user is
        not presently interacting with the (not yet active) application, it is not appropriate
        to return access credentials simultaneously in the authorization step.</t>

	There are security implications to encoding response values in the query string.
	The HTTP Referer header includes query parameters,
	and so any values encoded in query parameters will leak to third parties.
	Thus, while it is safe to encode an Authorization Code as a query parameter
	when using a Confidential Client (because it can't be used without the
	Client Secret, which third parties won't have), more sensitive information
	such as Access Tokens and ID Tokens MUST NOT be encoded in the query string.
	In no case should a set of response parameters whose default Response Mode
	is the fragment encoding be encoded using the query encoding.
	However, it is safe to return response parameters whose default Response Mode
	is the fragment encoding using the <spanx style="verb">form_post</spanx> Response Mode.
