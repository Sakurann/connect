<abstract><t>This specification defines an extension of OpenID Connect for providing Relying Parties with verified person data. This extension is intended to be used to verify the identity of a person in compliance with a certain law.</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>This specification aims at providing an extension to OpenID Connect <xref target="OpenID"></xref> to address the single use case of strong identity verification of a natural person in accordance with a certain laws. In Germany, for example, those would be the Anti Money Laundering Law, the Telecommunication Act, and eIDAS.
‚
There are use cases where Relying Parties need to know the assurance level of the user claims attested by the OpenID Connect OP.</t>
<t>Identity assurance signficantly differs from authentication assurance, which calls for a different representation in the OpenID Connect protocol.</t>
<t>The assurance level for authentication is a property of a certain OpenID Connect transaction, determined by the authentication means employed and the underlying user account management processes. A acr claim is sufficient to convey this information.</t>
<t>The identity assurance for user claims, i.e. the binding of a certain claim value to the person controlling the respective user account, tyically varies among the different user claims. For example, the assurance an OP typically will be able to attest for an e-mail address will be “self-asserted”, “verified by opt-in”, or “verified by the respective e-mail provider via an attribute exchange protocol”. The family name of a user, in contrast, might have been verified in accordance with the respective Anti Money Laundering Law by showing an ID Card to a trained employee of the OP operator. Identity assurance therefore requires a way to convey assurance data along with and coupled to the respective user claims.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>This section defines some terms relevant to the topic covered in this documents, heavily inspired by NIST SP 800-63A <xref target="NIST-SP-800-63a"></xref>.</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Identity Proofing - process in which a user provides evidence to an OP reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the OP to assert that identification at a useful identity assurance level.</t>
<t>Identify Verification - process conducted by the OP to verify the user's identity</t>
<t>Identity Assurance - process in which the OP attests identity data of a certain user with a certain assurance towards a RP, typically expressed by way of an assurance level. Depending on legal requirements, the OP may also be required to provide evidences of the identity proofing process to the RP.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="scope-and-requirements" title="Scope and Requirements">
<t>The extension specified in this document shall</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>allow a OpenID Connect RP to request identity data and to express requirements regarding this data and the evidences and processes employed,</t>
<t>allow an OP to attest identity data obtained and maintained in accordance with a certain law, and</t>
<t>allow the RP to map the data obtained from the OP to other laws, e.g. it shall be possible to use identity data maintained in accordance with the Anti Money Laundering Law to fulfill requirements defined by eIDAS.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The scope of the extension is to define mechanisms to assert person data only. It SHALL be possible to use existing OpenID Connect claims and other extensions defined beside this extension within the same OpenID Connect transaction and especially to render the same ID token or other representations utilized to convey user claims. For example, OpenID Connect already defines additional claims to inform the RP of the verification status of the <spanx style="verb">phone_number</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> claims.</t>
<t>If necessary, this extension will introduce new user claims to cover user attributes currently uncovered by OpenID Connect, one examples is the <spanx style="verb">place_of_birth</spanx>.</t>
<t>The extension MUST allow the OP to attest verified and unverified claims in the same response.</t>
<t>This extension defines a way to assert verified claims only since self asserted claims, or better put claims without further information about the assurance, are already covered by OpenID Connect.</t>
<t>Even for asserting verified claims, this extension shall attempt to utilize existing OpenID Connect claims if possible and reasonable. It MUST, however, ensure developers cannot interpret none-verified claims as verified claims.</t>
<t>The representation defined in this extension SHALL allow RPs to obtain assertions about verified claims from different OPs using different trust frameworks.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="claims" title="Claims">

<section anchor="userclaims" title="User Claims">
<t>In order to fulfill the requirements of some jurisdictions on identity assurance, this specification defines the following claims for conveying user data:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">place_of_birth</spanx>: a structured claim representing the end-user’s place of birth. It consists of the following fields:
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">country</spanx>: ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g. DE, or ISO 3166-3</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">locality</spanx>: city or other locality</t>
</list></t>
<t><spanx style="verb">nationality</spanx>: represents the user’s nationality in format ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2, e.g. DE</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">birth_name</spanx>: family name someone has when he or she is born, or at least from the time he or she is a child. This term can be used by a man or a woman who changes a name later in life for any reason.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="transaction-id" title="transaction_id">
<t>Strong identity verification typically requires the participants to keep an audit trail of the whole process, in order to be able to trace it back to its origins in case of a dispute or an audit.</t>
<t>This specification supports building an audit trail across the boundaries between OP and RP by introducing the claim <spanx style="verb">transaction_id</spanx>.</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">transaction_id</spanx> claim is a string value, which MUST be unique within the context of the respective OP, uniquely identify a certain transaction at the OP, and allow an RP to obtain further transaction details if needed.</t>
<t>The OP MUST maintain a corresponding audit trail for any transaction which lead to the attestation of verified person data. Those details consist of</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>the transaction id</t>
<t>the authentication methods employed</t>
<t>the transaction type (e.g. scope values)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The OP MUST store the transaction data as long as it is required to store transaction data for auditing purposes by its respective regulation.</t>
<t>The RP requests this claim like any other claim via the claims parameter or as part of a default claim set identified by a scope value.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="verified-data-representation" title="Verified Data Representation">
<t>This extension to OpenID Connect wants to ensure that RPs cannot mixup verified and unverified claims and incidentally process unverified claims as verified claims.</t>
<t>The representation proposed therefore provides the RP with the verified claims within a structured claim <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> composed of the verification evidences related to a certain verification process and the corresponding user claims, which were verified in this process.</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> claim consists of the following sub-elements:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">verification</spanx> This element contains all data about the verification process.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> This element is the container for the verified user claims.</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="verification" title="verification">
<t>This element contains the information about the process conducted to verify a person's identity and bind the respective person data to a user account.</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">verification</spanx> element consists of the following elements:</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">organization</spanx> REQUIRED. String value identifying the organisation that verified the person's identity</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">legal_context</spanx> REQUIRED. JSON Object determing the legal context governing the identification verification process conducted by the <spanx style="verb">organisation</spanx>. This object consists of the followung field:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">

<t><spanx style="verb">regulation</spanx> designation of the act or set of acts or directives, e.g. “Geldwäschegesetz”. Standardized values are:
<list style="symbols">
<t>“DE”, “Geldwäschegesetz”</t>
<t>[TBD]</t>
</list></t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Note by the editor: It might be reasonable to rename the <spanx style="verb">legal_context</spanx> element to <spanx style="verb">trust_framework</spanx> or something similar to clearly indicate it can also be used to cover NIST SP 800-3A or eIDAS Identity Proofing including the respective assurance levels.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">date</spanx> REQUIRED. time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 YYYY-MM-DD format representing the date when identity verification took place</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">id</spanx> REQUIRED. Unique reference to the identity verification process as performed by the verifying <spanx style="verb">organization</spanx>. Used for backtracking in case of disputes or audits. Note: In contrast to this field, the claim <spanx style="verb">transaction_id</spanx> refers to the transaction leading the OP to attest the user's verified identity data towards a RP.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">method</spanx> REQUIRED. Method utilized for identity verification - Depending on the value of “method”, there will be different additional sub-elements with the name of the method in the verification element - possible values are</t>

<section anchor="requesting-verified-person-data" title="Requesting Verified Person Data">

<section anchor="requesting-user-claims" title="Requesting User Claims">
<t>Verified person data can be requested on the level of individual user claims by utilzing the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> parameter as defined in Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification]@!OpenID].</t>
<t>Bassically, the claim <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> is added to the section &quot;userinfo&quot; or &quot;id_token&quot; of the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> parameter.</t>
<t>Since <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> contains the effective user claims in a nested <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> element, the syntax is extended to include expression on nested elements as follows. The <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> element includes a <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx>element, which in turn includes the desired user claims as keys with a <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> value. An example is shown in the following:</t>

<figure><artwork type="json">{  
   &quot;userinfo&quot;:{  
      &quot;verified_person_data&quot;:{  
         &quot;claims&quot;:{  
            &quot;given_name&quot;:null,
            &quot;family_name&quot;:null,
            &quot;birthdate&quot;:null,
            &quot;place_of_birth&quot;:null,
            &quot;nationality&quot;:null,
            &quot;address&quot;:null
         }
      }
   }	
}
</artwork></figure>

<t>Use of the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> parameter allows the RP to exactly select the user claims needed for their use case, this extension therefore allows RPs to fulfill the requirement for data minimization.</t>
<t>Note: A <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> sub-element with value <spanx style="verb">null</spanx> is interpreted as a request for all possible claims. An example is shown in the following:</t>

<figure><artwork type="json">{  
   &quot;userinfo&quot;:{  
      &quot;verified_person_data&quot;:{  
         &quot;claims&quot;:null
      }
   }	
}
</artwork></figure>

<t>Note: The <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> sub-element can be omitted, which is equivalent to a claims element whose value is <spanx style="verb">null</spanx>.</t>
<t>Note: If the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> sub-element is empty or contains a claim other than the claims listed in the Section <eref target="#claimselement">claims</eref>, the OP will abort the transaction with an <spanx style="verb">invalid_request</spanx> error.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="requesting-data-of-a-certain-age" title="Requesting Data of a certain age">
<t>The RP may also express a requirement regarding the age of the verification data, i.e., the time elapsed since the verification process asserted in the <spanx style="verb">verification</spanx> element has taken place.</t>
<t>This, again, requires an extension to the syntax as defined in Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect specification]@!OpenID] due to the nested nature of the <spanx style="verb">verified_person_data</spanx> claim.</t>
<t>The RP uses a <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> field on the sub-element <spanx style="verb">date</spanx> of the <spanx style="verb">verification</spanx> sub-claim that defines the maximum time elapsed since the verification process took place in seconds. The following is an example:</t>

<figure><artwork type="json">{  
   &quot;userinfo&quot;:{  
      &quot;verified_person_data&quot;:{  
         &quot;verification&quot;:{  
            &quot;date&quot;:{  
               &quot;max_age&quot;:&quot;63113852&quot;
            }
         },
         &quot;claims&quot;:null
      }
   }
}
</artwork></figure>

<t>The IDP SHOULD try to fulfill this requirement. If the verification data of the user is older than the requested <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>, it SHOULD attempt to refresh the user’s verification by sending her through a online identity verification process, e.g. by utilizing an electronic ID card or a video identification approach.</t>
<t>If the IDP is unable to fulfill the requirement, there are two possible outcomes of the transaction:</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>If the RP did not request <spanx style="verb">date</spanx> as essential claim, the IDP will provide the RP with the data available and the RP may decide how to use the data.</t>
<t>If the RP requested <spanx style="verb">date</spanx> as essential claim, the IDP will abort the transaction and respond with the (new) error code <spanx style="verb">unable_to_meet_requirement</spanx>.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The following is an example of a claims parameter requesting <spanx style="verb">date</spanx> as essential claim.</t>
