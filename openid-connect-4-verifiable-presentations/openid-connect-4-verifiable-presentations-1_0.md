.# Abstract

This specification defines an extension of OpenID Connect to allow presentation of claims in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials as part of the protocol flow in addition to claims provided in the `id_token` and/or via Userinfo responses.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

This specification extends OpenID Connect with support for presentation of claims via W3C Verifiable Credentials. This allows existing OpenID Connect RPs to extends their reach towards claims sources asserting claims in this format. It also allows new applications built using Verifiable Credentials to utilize OpenID Connect as integration and interoperability layer towards credential holders. 

# Use Cases

## Verifier accesses Wallet via OpenID Connect

A Verifier uses OpenID Connect to obtain verifiable presentations. This is a simple and mature way to obtain identity data. From a technical perspective, this also makes integration with OAuth-protected APIs easier as OpenID Connect is based on OAuth.  

## Existing OpenID Connect RP integrates SSI wallets

An application currently utilizing OpenID Connect for accessing various federated identity providers can use the same protocol to also integrate with emerging SSI-based wallets. Thats an conveient transition path leveraging existing expertise and protecting investments made.

## Existing OpenID Connect OP as custodian of End-User Credentials

An existing OpenID Connect may extends its service by maintaining credentials issued by other claims sources on behalf of its customers. Customers can mix claims of the OP and from their credentials to fulfil authentication requests. 

## Federated OpenID Connect OP adds device-local mode

An extisting OpenID Connect OP with a native user experience (PWA or native app) issues Verifiable Credentials and stores it on the user's device linked to a private key residing on this device under the user's control. For every authentication request, the native user experience first checks whether this request can be fulfilled using the locally stored credentials. If so, it generates a presentations signed with the user's keys in order to prevent replay of the credential. 

This approach dramatically reduces latency and reduces load on the OP's servers. Moreover, the user can identity, authenticate, and authorize even in situations with unstable or without internet connectivity. 
# Terminology

Credential

A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. (see https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology)

Verifiable Credential (VC)

A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified. The claims in a credential can be about different subjects. (see https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology)

Presentation

Data derived from one or more verifiable credentials, issued by one or more issuers, that is shared with a specific verifier. (see https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology)

Verified Presentation (VP)

A verifiable presentation is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from, but do not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs). (see https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology)

W3C Verifiable Credential Objects

Both verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations
# Overview 

This specification defines mechanisms to allow RPs to request and OPs to provide Verifiable Presentations via OpenID Connect. 

Verifiable Presentations are used to present claims along with cryptographic proofs of the link between presenter and subject of the verifiable credentials it contains. A verifiable presentation can contain a subset of claims asserted in a certain credential (selective disclosure) and it can assemble claims from different credentials. 

There are two credential formats to VCs and VPs: JSON or JSON-LD. There are also two proof formats to VCs and VPs: JWT and Linked Data Proofs. Each of those formats has different properties and capabilites and each of them comes with different proof types. Proof formats are agnostic to the credential format chosen. However, the JSON credential format is commonly used with JSON Web Signatures (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token). JSON-LD is commonly used with different kinds of Linked Data Proofs and JSON Web Signatures (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld). Applications can use all beforementioned assertion and proof formats with this specification. 

This specification introduces the following representations to exchange verifiable credentials objectes between OpenID OPs and RPs.

* The JWT claim `verifiable_presentations` used as generic container to embed verifiable presentation objects into ID tokens or userinfo responses.
* The new token types "VP Token" used as generic container for verifiable presentation objects in authentication and token responses in addition to ID Tokens.

All representations share the same container format.
# Container Format

A verifiable presentation container is an array of objects, each of them containing the following fields:

`format`: REQUIRED A JSON string denoting the proof format the presentation was returned in. This specification introduces the values `jwt_vp` and `ldp_vp` to denote credentials in JSON-LD and JWT format, respectively, as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].  

`presentation` : REQUIRED. A W3C Verifiable Presentation with a cryptographically verifiable proof in the defined proof format. 

Note that OP would first encode VPs using the rules defined in the Verifiable Credential specification either in JWT format or JSON-LD format, before encoded VPs as container objects.

Here is an example: 

```json
[
   {
      "format":"jwt_vp",
      "presentation":

# JWT parameters extention

Verifiable credential objects can be exchanged between OP and RP enveloped in JWT claims in ID tokens or userinfo responses.  

This specification introduces the following JWT claim for that purpose:

- `verifiable_presentations`:  A claim whose value is a verifiable presentations container object as defined above.

This claim can be added to ID Tokens, Userinfo responses as well as Access Tokens and Introspection response. It MAY also be included as aggregated or distributed claims (see Section 5.6.2 of the OpenID Connect specification [OpenID]).

Note that above claim has to be distinguished from `vp` or `vc` claims as defined in [JWT proof format](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token). `vp` or `vc` claims contain those parts of the standard verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations where no explicit encoding rules for JWT exist. They are used as part of a verifiable credential or presentation in JWT format. They are not meant to include complete verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations objects which is the purpose of the claims defined in this specification.

# New Tokens extention

This specifications introduces the following new token:

* VP Token: a token containing a verifiable presentations container as defined above. Such a token is provided to the RP in addition to an `id_token` in the `vp_token` parameter. 

`vp_token` is provided in the same response as the `id_token`. Depending on the response type, this can be either the authentication response or the token response. Authentication event information is conveyed via the id token while it's up to the RP to determine what (additional) claims are allocated to `id_token` and `vp_token`, respectively, via the `claims` parameter. 

If the `vp_token` is returned in the frontchannel, a hash of the respective token MUST be included in `id_token`.

# Requesting Verifiable Presentations 

This draft extends the existing OpenID Connect `claims` request parameter to allow RPs to request verifiable presentations using the request syntax defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

## Embedded Verifiable Presentations {#verifiable_presentations}

Verifiable Presentations are requested by embedding a `verifiable_presentations` element containing a `presentation_definition` element as defined in Section 4 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] to the `id_token` (or `userinfo`) top level element of the `claims` parameter. 

Please note this draft defines a profile of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] as follows: 

* The `presentation_definition.id` element is optional
* The field `presentation_definition.input_descriptorid` is optional
* The `presentation_definition` element MAY contain all other elements as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] except the `format` element.

Note: supported presentation formats, proof types, and algorithms are determined using new RP and OP metadata (see (#metadata)). 

Here is a non-normative example: 

<{{examples/request/id_token_type_only.json}}

This simple example requests the presentation of a credential of a certain type. 

The following example

<{{examples/request/id_token_type_and_claims.json}}

shows how the RP can request selective dislosure or certain claims from a credential of a particular type. 

RPs can also ask for alternative credentials being presented, which is shown in the next example:

<{{examples/request/id_token_alternative_credentials.json}}

## VP Token

A VP Token is requested by adding a new top level element `vp_token` to the `claims` parameter. This element contains a `presentation_definition` element as defined in Section 4 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] following the profile as defined in (#verifiable_presentations). 

This is illustrated in the following example:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_only.json}}

# Metadata {#metadata}

This specification introduces additional metadata to enable RP and OP to determine the verifiable presentation formats, proof types and algorithms to be used in a protocol exchange. 

## RP Metadata

RPs indicate the suported formats using the follwoing element.

* `vp_formats`: an object defining the formats, proof types and algorithms a RP supports. The is based on the definition of the `format` elememt in a `presentation_definition` as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] with the supported formats `jwt_vp` and `ldp_vp`.

Here is an example for a RP registering with a Standard OP via dynamic client registration:

<{{examples/client_metadata/client_code_format.json}}

Here is an example for a SIOP RP to be used as value of the `registration` request parameter:

<{{examples/client_metadata/client_siop_format.json}}

## OP Metadata

The OP publishes the formats it supports using the `vp_formats` metadata parameter as defined above in its "openid-configuration". 

# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

To prevent replay attacks, verifiable presentation container objects MUST be linked to `client_id` and if provided `nonce` from the Authentication Request. The `client_id` is used 
to detect presentation of credentials to a different than the intended party. The `nonce` value binds the presentation to a certain authentication transaction and allows
the verifier to detect injection of a presentation in the OpenID Connect flow, which is especially important in flows where the presentation is passed through the front channel. 

The values are passed through unmodified from the Authentication Request to the verifiable presentations. 

Note: These values MAY be represented in different ways (directly as claims or indirectly be incoporation in proof calculation) according to the selected proof format denated by the format claim in the verifiable presentation container.

Here is a non-normative example for format=`jwt_vp` (only relevant part):

```json
{
  "iss": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  "jti": "urn:uuid:3978344f-8596-4c3a-a978-8fcaba3903c5",
  "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "nonce": "343s$FSFDa-",
  "nbf": 1541493724,
  "iat": 1541493724,
  "exp": 1573029723,
  "vp": {
    "@context": [
      "<https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",>
      "<https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1">
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],

    "verifiableCredential": [""]
  }
}
```

In the example above, `nonce` is included as the `nonce` and `client_id` as the `aud` value in the proof of the verifiable presentation.

Here is a non-normative example for format=`ldp_vp` (only relevant part):

```json
{
  "@context": [ ... ],
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "verifiableCredential": [ ... ],
  "proof": {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "created": "2018-09-14T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",    
    "challenge": "343s$FSFDa-",
    "domain": "s6BhdRkqt3",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..kTCYt5
      XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVIw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgREEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qq_PbChOMqs
      LfRoPsnsgxD-WUcX16dUOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPktb3rk-BuQy72IFLN25DYuNzVBAh
      4vGHSrQyHUGlcTwLtjPAnKb78"
  }
}
```

In the example above, `nonce` is included as the `challenge` and `client_id` as the `domain` value in the proof of the verifiable presentation.

#  Examples 

This section illustrates examples when W3C Verifiable Credentials objects are requested using `claims` parameter and returned inside ID Tokens.

## Self-Issued OpenID Provider with Verifiable Presentation in ID Token 

Below are the examples when W3C Verifiable Credentials are requested and returned inside ID Token as part of Self-Issued OP response. ID Token contains a `verifiable_presentations` claim with the Verifiable Presentation data. It can also contain `verifiable_credentials` element with the Verifiable Credential data. 

### Authentication request

The following is a non-normative example of how an RP would use the `claims` parameter to request the `verifiable_presentations` claim in the `id_token`:

```
  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: openid://?
    response_type=id_token
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid
    &claims=...
    &nonce=960848874
    &registration_uri=https%3A%2F%2F
      client.example.org%2Frf.txt%22%7D
      
```
#### `claims` parameter 

Below is a non-normative example of how the `claims` parameter can be used for requesting verified presentations containg a credential of a certain type.

<{{examples/request/id_token_health.json}}

### Authentication Response 

Below is a non-normative example of ID Token that includes `verifiable_presentations` claim.
Note: the RP was setup with the preferred format `jwt_vp`.

```json
{
  "kid": "did:ion:EiC6Y9_aDaCsITlY06HId4seJjJ...b1df31ec42d0",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES256K"
}.{
   "iss":"https://self-issued.me/v2",
   "aud":"https://client.example.org/cb",
   "iat":1615910538,
   "exp":1615911138,
   "sub":"did:ion:EiC6Y9_aDaCsITlY06HId4seJjJ-9...mS3NBIn19",
   "auth_time":1615910535,
   "nonce":"960848874",
   "verifiable_presentations":[
      {
         "format":"jwt_vp",
         "presentation":"ewogICAgImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYm9vay5pdHNvdXJ3ZWIub...IH0="
      }
   ]
}
```

Below is a non-normative example of a decoded Verifiable Presentation object that was included in `verifiable_presentations` in `jwt_vp` format (see [VC-DATA-MODEL]).
Note: in accordance with (#security_considerations) the verifiable presentation's `nonce` claim is set to the value of the `nonce` request parameter value and the `client_id` claim contains the RP's `client_id`.

```json
  {
    "iss":"did:ion:EiC6Y9_aDaCsITlY06HId4seJjJ...b1df31ec42d0",
    "aud":"https://client.example.org/cb",
    "iat":1615910538,
    "exp":1615911138,   
    "nbf":1615910538,
    "nonce":"960848874",
    "vp":{
        "@context":[
          "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
          "https://ohip.ontario.ca/v1"
        ],
        "type":[
          "VerifiablePresentation"
        ],
        "verifiableCredential":[
          "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InVybjp1dWlkOjU0ZDk2NjE2LTE1MWUt...OLryT1g"    
        ]
    }   
  }
```

## Self-Issued OpenID Provider with Verifiable Presentation in ID Token (selective disclosure)
### `claims` parameter 

Below is a non-normative example of how the `claims` parameter can be used for requesting verified presentations with selective disclosure.
Note: the RP was setup with the preferred format `ldp_vp`.

<{{examples/request/id_token_type_and_claims.json}}

### Authentication Response 

Below is a non-normative example of an ID Token that includes `verifiable_presentations` claim.

Note: in accordance with (#security_considerations) the verifiable presentation's `challenge` claim is set to the value of the `nonce` request parameter value and the `domain` claim contains the RP's `client_id`.

## Authorization Code Flow with vp_token

This section illustrates the protocol flow for the case of communication using frontchannel and backchannel (utilizing the authorization code flow).

### Authentication Request

```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=s6BhdRkqt3 
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=openid
    &claims=...
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
```

#### Claims parameter

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_and_claims.json}}

### Authentication Response
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
    code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
    &state=af0ifjsldkj
```

### Token Request
```
  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

  grant_type=authorization_code
  &code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
```

### Token Response (including vp_token)

This is the example token response containing a `vp_token` containg a verifiable presentation (and credential) in LD Proof format. 
Note: in accordance with (#security_considerations) the verifiable presentation's `challenge` claim is set to the value of the `nonce` request parameter value and the `domain` claim contains the RP's `client_id`.
