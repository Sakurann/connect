    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines how an OpenID Authentication 2.0 relying
      party can migrate the user from OpenID 2.0 identifier to OpenID Connect
      Identifier by using an ID Token that includes the OpenID 2.0 verified
      claimed ID. In this specification, the method to request such an
      additional claim and the method for the verification of the resulting ID
      Token is specified.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>OpenID Authentication 2.0 is a popular authentication federation
      protocol through which the relying party can obtain the user&rsquo;s
      verified identifier from the OpenID Provider (OP) to which the user was
      authenticated. OpenID Connect is a newer version of it but the
      identifier format is different and thus relying parties need to migrate
      those user identifiers to continue accepting such users.</t>

      <t>In this specification, a standard method for this kind of migration
      on a per user basis is described.</t>

      <section anchor="rnc" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

        same term is defined in both specifications, the term defined in
        OpenID Connect Core takes precedence.</t>

             title="Requesting the OpenID 2.0 Identifier and Connect iss/sub pair together">
      <t>To obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, the RP sends a modified OpenID
      Connect Authentication Request by adding <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      as an additional scope value.</t>

      <t>If PPID was used to obtain the OpenID 2.0 Identifier, 
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx>
      has to be sent to the OP with the request. For this purpose, a new
      authentication request parameter <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>
      is defined.</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="openid2_realm"><vspace />OPTIONAL. The <spanx

        </list>If the authority section of Authorization Endpoint URI is
      different from the authority section of the OpenID 2.0 OP&rsquo;s OP
      Endpoint URL, the client MUST issue a GET request to it with 
      an Accept header set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx> 
      to obtain the value of 
      <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim in it. 
      The value of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim 
      obtained this way and the value of 
      the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> 
      claim in the ID Token MUST exactly match.
      </t>

      <t><spanx style="strong">Note</spanx>: This is similar to YADIS. In case
      of YADIS, it is using Accept header with its value set to

        <t>NOTE: The OpenID 2.0 Identifiers can be mapped to a static file

      <section title="Correlation">
        <t>This standard essentially is a correlation specification. It
        correlates the OpenID Connect identifier with OpenID 2.0 Identifier.
        In the usual case where the user has only one account and the Connect
        and OpenID 2.0 OPs look similar, then the user probably would be
        expecting that those identifiers to be correlated silently. However,
        if the OPs looks very different, then some users may prefer not to be
        correlated. As such, the OP SHOULD make sure that to ask the user if
        the user wants to correlate.</t>

        <t>When multiple accounts are available for the user, then the OP MUST

      <section title=" Identification by other parties">
        <t>Since the channel is encrypted, this risk is low. If the channel
        was vulnerable, then user identifiers and other attributes will be
        exposed and thus allows the attacker to identify the user. To avoid
        it, the parties can employ ID Token encryption as well.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Secondary Use">
        <t>While there is no technical control in this standard as to the
        secondary use is concerned, RP is strongly advised to announce its
        policy against secondary use in its privacy policy. Secondary use
        usually is associated with privacy impact, so its legitimacy should be
        carefully evaluated.</t>

      <section title="Disclosure">
        <t>Since the channel is encrypted, this risk is low. If the channel

    <section title="Difference to Google&rsquo;s migration guide as of June 3, 2014 ">
      <t>In this appendix, the differences between this spec and the
      Google&rsquo;s migration guide as of June 3, 2014 is explained. The
      differences are categorized in accordance with the section number of
      this specification. Google's migration guide is available at <eref 
      target="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OpenID#openid-connect">
      Migrating to OAuth 2.0 login (OpenID Connect)
      </eref>.
      </t>

      <t><xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="RequestOpenid2Id" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> instead. Since
      OpenID Connect uses param_name style instead of <spanx style="verb">param.name</spanx>,
      as well as the name <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> may mislead
      the user that it is a Connect parameter proper, it has been changed to
      <spanx style="verb">openid2_realm</spanx>.</t>

      <t>Google uses the existence of 
      <spanx style="verb">openid.realm</spanx> parameter to switch the
      behavior at the Connect OP. New scope value <spanx style="verb">openid2</spanx>
      has been introduced in this spec to make it more explicit and
      semantically in-line that it is asking for a resource.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyRP" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyRP" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform RP verification.</t>

      <t><xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="ReturnOpenID2ID" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google uses <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> instead of <spanx
      style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> . It was changed to <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx>
      because <spanx style="verb">openid_id</spanx> may cause confusion among
      people that it is the Connect identifier. Since this spec allows
      providing <spanx style="verb">openid2_id</spanx> even after the OpenID
      2.0 OP has been taken down, this claim may persists much longer than the
      OpenID 2.0 OP. Thus, the chance of confusion should be minimized. </t>

      <t>Google does not take care of XRI while this standard does.</t>

      <t><xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="counter" />. 
      <xref target="VerifyOPAuthority" format="title" /></t>

      <t>Google does not perform authority verification.</t>
